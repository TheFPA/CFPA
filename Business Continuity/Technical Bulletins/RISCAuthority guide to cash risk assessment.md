![](./media/image8.jpeg) **1. INTRODUCTION**

> **1.1 Purpose of this guide**
> 
> This guide has been produced to assist commercial insurance
> underwriters and risk control surveyors in their assessment of
> UK-located risks presenting significant money exposures, and in their
> specifying of security precautions in order to improve those risks
> where existing loss prevention measures are considered to be
> inadequate.
> 
> A model *aide-memoire* has been included as Appendix 1 for use by risk
> control surveyors (with augmentation or adaptation according to
> individual insurers’ risk appetite and risk assessment practices).
> 
> **1.2 Scope**
> 
> The guide is focused upon the potential for significant loss (and the
> risk management of such potential) arising from the criminal actions
> of third parties, within the context of the cover typically provided
> by the money section of a commercial insurance policy. It thus does
> not extend to address those risks that are the subject of fidelity or
> theft by employee insurance policies; nor does it address the theft of
> money by fraud or electronic means.
> 
> For the purposes of this document, a significant money exposure is
> deemed to be one where there is the potential for the theft of money
> in excess of £30,000, and the guide is therefore intended to address
> the money-related risk management of businesses such as medium to
> large retailers, cash and carry outlets, visitor attractions,
> exhibition centres, sports stadia, cash centres, casinos, bureaux de
> change, banks, building societies and the like.
> 
> Whilst the guide has been produced with a clear focus on the security
> of cash, much of its content is equally relevant to significant
> exposures of vouchers, stamps, banker’s drafts and other negotiable
> instruments typically covered by commercial money insurances (though
> it is recognised that insurers will often apply tolerances in respect
> of non-cash negotiables, as regards the level of exposure permitted
> before enhanced security measures are required as a condition of
> cover).

![](./media/image10.jpeg) **2. MONEY RISK ASSESSMENT**

> **2.1 Risk appreciation and assessment**
> 
> When carrying out a money insurance survey, it is important that the
> surveyor appreciates the extent and detail of money insurance
> conditions applicable to the case in order to avoid the risk of
> unwittingly undermining the policy’s intent, for example by implying
> acceptance of circumstances that pertain at the time of survey which
> may breach those conditions.
> 
> Such conditions may typically relate to key security, use of intruder
> alarm systems, cash carrying precautions, money in vehicles, etc.
> 
> **2.2 Risk exposures and loss potentials**
> 
> The loss of money by theft can occur through a variety of methods and
> the key risk scenarios faced by large cash risk (which are described
> in paragraph 2.2.2 below) should be assessed in terms of cash loss
> potential, relative likelihood and adequacy of precautions currently
> in place to prevent or minimise losses.
> 
> In many cases, it will be determined that 100% cash losses are
> conceivable with some risk scenarios.
> 
> In addition to the loss of money, some criminal methods involve the
> risk of personal injury to staff (and perhaps also to the
> policyholder’s customers and other third parties at the scene of an
> attack) and/or significant interruption to the business for which
> 
> the insurer may provide indemnity under Employer’s Liability, Public
> Liability and Business Interruption covers.

***2.2.1 Staff safety***

All staff involved with cash exposures, whether front-line
customer-facing, back-room cash-office, managerial or security
personnel, face jeopardy and potential personal injury risks arising
from their duties. Even those with no direct custody of, or authority to
access, money could find themselves involved in a threatening situation
simply through their presence at the scene of a criminal attack.

The business is, of course, obliged by the Health and Safety at Work Act
to provide a safe place of work and safe systems of work, and also to
provide adequate training and instruction for employees. Furthermore,
the Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations require risk
assessments to be undertaken and recorded for all significant and
reasonably foreseeable risks. Employee records should show the content
and date of the training provided and employees should sign an
acknowledgement to indicate they have received the training given.
Training records are to be maintained for all employees to assist in the
review process and also to provide evidence that training has duly been
provided as these may assist in defence of any potential civil claims.

The risks to staff safety arising from the threat of criminal attack
reflect the degree of target-appeal to criminals, but can be mitigated
very significantly if the policyholder adopts a responsible approach to
health and safety issues, carries out risk assessments in a professional
manner and ensures that security measures are in place that are
commensurate with the risk. In many cases, the safeguards that are
introduced to protect cash, particularly during working hours, will
generally also contribute to staff safety and vice versa, especially
when those safeguards are obviously robust, since an evidently high
standard of security will help to deter an attack.

***2.2.2 Key risk scenarios***

Each of the following key risk scenarios should be considered in any
risk assessment of a large money risk:

> *Robbery at the premises during working hours*

(i) During trading hours

Most cash-heavy businesses present an open-door welcome to the public,
and even those that restrict transactions to certain categories (eg
minimum age, trade-only or members-only) will generally not keep their
customer entrance doors secured during trading hours.

> A robbery during trading hours often involves minimal inside knowledge
> or planning, but can be very violent and frightening to both staff and
> customers.

(ii) Out of trading hours

The periods at the beginning and end of each working day, when staff are
on the premises but the business is closed to the public, may seem a
more attractive proposition to criminals who are able to research their
target since, provided they can gain access to the premises (eg by
‘tail-gating’ a member of staff as they arrive for work, or hiding
themselves within the premises during ‘open-hours’ and emerging from
hiding after the premises have been closed to customers), they then have
a better prospect of a more manageable raid, more time to maximise their
haul, and a better chance of escaping unchallenged.

4

*Theft from the premises out of business hours*

> For those criminals who have the skill, knowledge and organisation to
> successfully penetrate secured premises and tackle locked safes and
> other secured money containers whilst avoiding discovery ‘in the act’,
> a burglary out of business hours can offer maximum cash rewards
> without some of the attendant risks of violent crime (ie
> eye-witnesses, ‘have-a-go’ heroism, hold-up alarms, sentencing policy
> if caught and convicted, etc).
> 
> ***Staff duress and tiger kidnap***
> 
> It is not unknown for key-holding members of staff to be accosted
> outside or well away from the business premises (eg on the way home

> 2.3 Risk reduction approaches – basic principles**

Having determined the threats facing the business in terms of theft of
money, and the extent of any possible loss in the event of a determined
and successful criminal attack, it is necessary to evaluate existing
precautions aimed at mitigating such threats and preventing or reducing
such losses.

The various precautionary measures that should be adopted (or at least
considered) for the protection of both staff and money are examined in
the following sections of the guide, but the basic principles that need
to be addressed – in combination – are:

***Target hardening***

All significant cash risks must be defended against criminal attack to a
standard that is at least commensurate with the perceived level of
threat. For most large cash risks this will include a mix of physical,
electronic and organisational security measures aimed at protecting
staff against attack and money against theft. Target hardening can be
achieved by both passive and active defences. In terms of ‘physical’
defences, for example, cashiers may be protected by fixed
security-glazed screens or alternatively with button-operated rising
screens.

> ***Minimising the appeal***
> 
> Part of the risk management of significant money exposures has to do
> with the psychology of deterrence and threat diversion.

Large money losses generally involve a good deal of research and
planning on the part of the criminal and the risks of failure and arrest
will be important factors in determining whether an attack is launched.
If the premises appear to be well defended, the staff professional and
well disciplined, and there is considered to be a real possibility that
physical defences may prevail, that an alarm would be raised and
responded to before the raid is completed, or that other defensive
measures would be successfully deployed, then the criminal will
hopefully be deterred, and deflected towards apparently ‘softer’
targets.

> ***Minimising the reward***

Introducing measures that will significantly reduce the amount of cash
at risk of theft are not only of value in regard to minimising the size
of a potential claim, but also reduce the likelihood of an attack, at
least by criminals who research their targets beforehand.

In some cases, if the customer is able (and prepared) to introduce
significant changes, it may be possible to reduce cash exposure to zero
by, for example, switching to a cashless transaction trading model, at
least within some parts of the business operation, or at some key stages
of the business cycle. Where this can be successfully achieved, the
risks of injury and loss through violent attack will be significantly
reduced, and much of the cost of additional security measures can be
avoided.

Physical and procedural arrangements can be deployed which will, for
example, limit the amount of cash immediately available at vulnerable
cashier positions or on cash-collection rounds. Other security measures
can be installed that stain or otherwise degrade stolen banknotes, with
consequent impact on their disposal by thieves.

    managers)

  - The company’s security policy

  - Avoiding breaches and lapses in security (eg security of access
    codes/tokens, visitor/contractor identification/ validation,
    improper use of fire exit doors, etc)

  - The identification and reporting of suspicious incidents, vehicles,
    persons and behaviour

  - Raising an alarm: means and correct circumstances

  - What to do during a robbery (noting descriptions, etc)

  - What to do after a robbery (preserving the crime scene, calling the

6

> ***Premises opening***

Upon arrival at the premises, the outside of the premises should be
checked for any signs of intrusion or suspicious activity. If all
appears well, one (preferably two) personnel should unlock the entry
door, unset the intruder alarm and ensure that all appears to be in
order – both from a visual check of the interior, and according to the
alarm keypad display, whilst the second (preferably third) remains
outside the building, acting as look out and ready to call the police if
anything untoward occurs, whilst awaiting a message or signal from those
inside that all is well.

Entrance doors should remain locked until customer trading hours
commence, with access during the interim available only via supervised
entry doors to staff and authorised visitors/contractors.

Customer entry doors should be unlocked at the appointed time, but only
after checks are made to ensure that all internal doors from public to
staff-only areas are properly secured.

> ***Premises closing***

There should be a strict observance of closing times and a systematic
process for (i) denying public entry close to the end of trading hours,
(ii) clearing the building of remaining customers and (iii) searching
the premises for any unauthorised persons who may be in hiding. All
tills and other cash containers not suitable for holding money out of
business hours should be emptied, and all cash locked away in safes or
strong-rooms. Emptied tills and other day-time-only containers should be
left unlocked and open in order to minimise damage in the event of
overnight intrusion.

One or two personnel should leave the premises ahead of their colleagues
to check the environs outside the exit door for signs of suspicious
activity and then, from a safe distance, communicate the ‘safe to leave’
status to their colleagues within. They should then continue to watch
the locking-up process until it is safely concluded. The bulk of the
staff should leave together where possible, with one or two persons left
briefly inside to set the intruder alarm whilst a number of their
colleagues remain outside the final exit door until the duty keyholder
has locked the final exit door and the alarm setting procedure is
completed.

Note: More comprehensive advice concerning opening and closing
procedures is contained in the RISCAuthority guide S6: Electronic
security systems: Guidance on keyholder selection and duties.

***3.5.2 Opening and closing procedures (in response to an alarm)***

There should also be well defined, documented and observed procedures
for attendance at the premises outside normal working hours in response
to an alarm activation or some other reported emergency.

Calls purporting to be from an alarm receiving centre, the police or
some other authority requesting keyholder attendance should be validated
by ring-back to known (pre-stored) numbers before keyholders set out. A
minimum of two keyholders should attend in every instance.

Whether the policyholder appoints in-house staff to keyholder duties, or
contracts approved professional keyholding services, an on-call duty
security manager or other senior member of management should also be
contacted at the outset, appraised of the situation, and should then
remotely monitor developments via frequent telephone communications with
the attending keyholders until satisfied that the situation is resolved
and the premises have been re-secured.

> As with opening and closing responsibilities in normal operating

> 
> ***3.5.3 Access management***

> The system should individually identify all users and should be

  - All cards/tokens are accounted for at all times

  - Cards/tokens are retrieved from staff who leave the policyholder’s
    employment

  - Any lost or stolen cards/tokens are deleted from the system and
    rendered inoperative

• Activity records are regularly supervised for inappropriate or
unexpected usage patterns (eg those that may suggest borrowing/sharing
of cards/tokens, the propping-open of doors or tailgating)

**4.1 Cash and wages offices**

For operational as well as security reasons, cash accumulations are
frequently best managed within a single office or suite at the
policyholder’s premises.

For the purposes of this document, reference to ‘cash office’ should be
taken to include ‘wage office/payroll office/cash payments department,
etc’ whilst acknowledging that such latter functions are comparative
rarities today, with most salaries, wages and other payments being made
by BACS, cheques and other cash-free means.

***4.1.1 Location***

Cash offices should ideally be located well away from areas where the
public have access, preferably on an upper floor (generally speaking,
the higher, the better, so maximising the deterrent effect to raiders of
having to negotiate several floors with the attendant risk of being
trapped within the premises by responding personnel/police).

If an upper floor location is not available, then the cash office
should, if possible, be located as centrally as possible within the
basement or ground floor, away from the building perimeter walls, and
maximising travel distances from external doors and from publicly
accessible parts of the premises.

It should not be possible for those outside the cash office to view its
interior. Where a cash room is situated against an outside wall
therefore, any windows (including upper floor windows that are
overlooked by other buildings) should be effectively screened in some
way (see 4.1.2).

Any external glazing to the cash room should, if it is accessible from
outside (eg situated at ground floor level, or accessible from a flat
roof, balcony or fire escape staircase), be to the same security
standard as applied to its internal glazed areas. Where the risk
assessment indicates such glazing to be ‘normally inaccessible’, the
risk of attack from the roof of the building (eg using window-cleaner
cradles, abseiling techniques, etc) should still be addressed, and fixed
(non-opening) security glazing should be considered. Furthermore, if
normally inaccessible windows offer the possibility of line-of-fire
threat from neighbouring properties, external fire escapes, etc into a
cash office that is otherwise protected to bullet resistant standard,
then such windows should also be fitted with bullet resistant glazing
(or alternatively bricked-up or shuttered with minimum 6mm mild steel).

Security glazing, whether bullet resistant or manual attack resistant
should be installed in accordance with BS 5357: Code of practice for
installation and application of security glazing.

*Doors*

Entry into the cash room should be via a proprietary security door-set
to either manual attack resistant or bullet resistant standard,
according to the risk assessment.<sup>8, 9</sup>

Where the desired standard is bullet resistance, the door-set should be
specified to an appropriate class (typically FB4/FSG NS of BS EN 1522:
Windows, doors, shutters and blinds. Bullet resistance. Requirements and
classification).

Wherever possible, access into the cash room should be via a security
lobby comprising a pair of ‘in series, interlocked’ security doors such
that neither door can be unlocked and opened unless the other door is
closed and locked, and passage into and out of the room is thus via a
quarantined area (often referred to as an ‘airlock’). Where such an
arrangement is in place, it is recommended that the ‘security line’ (ie
the barrier maintaining the manual attack or bullet resistant integrity
of the cash office) is focused on the inner door of the pair and the
inner partition of the lobby (separating it from the cash office
interior) so that cash office personnel can safely validate persons
within the lobby before releasing the inner door. The outer door, and
outer partition to the lobby, thus need not necessarily be constructed
to the same high resistance standard.

Access doors should normally open outwards from the cash room, so that
the door frame rebate can lend support to the door’s locks and bolts in
resisting any attempts to kick or hammer open the door. (Where such a
door must, for logistical or safety reasons, open inwards, it should be
ensured that the door-set has been certified against attack on the face
in question).

Any emergency exit door from the cash room should be to at least the
same standard as the access door(s), fitted with high quality
locks/bolts (whilst allowing for emergency egress during working hours,
see RISCAuthority guide S11: Security of emergency exit doors in
non-residential premises) and alarm protected on a 24-hour circuit.

<sup>10</sup> Note: for health and safety purposes, an emergency access
facility should be provided using means not readily available to
unauthorised personnel (eg a management-only code) so that assistance
may be provided to any person within the cash room who is unwell,
unconscious or otherwise indisposed.

  - on-site and off-site communications equipment

  - hold-up alarm buttons (fixed devices within the control room and

In practice (due to the technological solutions employed by the alarm
industry), duress facilities cannot be easily applied to some of the
unsetting arrangements permitted by BS 8243<sup>11</sup>, and in most
instances, in order to achieve police response for a duress alarm and to
provide a sufficiently secure means of unsetting, the choice is limited
to unsetting option 6.4.3 of BS 8243, namely: “Prevention of entry to
the supervised premises before all means of intruder alarm confirmation
have been disabled”.

anticipated maximum police attendance times, as ‘professional’ criminals
will normally factor-in a reasonable expectation of an alarm being
raised and the police being called to attend. Experience suggests
however that many policyholders will argue that a safe time delay of
20-minutes or more is impracticable with regard to the normal
operational needs of the business and it may be necessary to settle for
a shorter delay (possibly insufficient to maximise the chances of police
intervention but nevertheless sufficient to deter the majority of
potential raiders). An absolute minimum delay of 5-minutes is
recommended.

An alternative compromise solution is sometimes found with the use of a
safe ‘coffer’ built-in or retro-fitted within the safe which is used to
contain the bulk of the cash, and is fitted with the time delay device
whilst ‘on-call’ cash is left outside the coffer, though still within
the locked safe. Depending on trading patterns and other operational
factors, it may be possible with such an arrangement to introduce a more
significant time-delay in relation to the large loss scenario.

It is important to display clear signage in support of the intended
deterrent effect, confirming the deployment of such devices, and the
inability of staff to circumvent them (ie to avoid or shorten the
delay).

In cases where there will be frequent placements of cash into the safe
during the working day, but more than one or two withdrawals from the
safe are not needed, it may be advisable to install a ‘deposit safe’ so
that the person responsible for cash receipts can ‘post’ them into the
safe without opening the safe door, and thus need not be issued with a
key, combination number or PIN. Another member of staff (usually a more
senior person) is authorised and equipped to open the safe door to
remove deposited receipts, typically one per day or once per shift. If
practical, it is safer to do this when the premises are closed for
business, customers/visitors have left the building and the premises are
secured.

As with time-delay devices, good signage notifying potential raiders of
the fact that staff do not have the means to open the safe, will help to
maximise the deterrence value.

Note: see also paragraph 5.2.5.4 concerning the use of time locks as a
defence against hold-up.

**4.6 Cashier counters**

In some cases, cashier counters provide a direct transaction facility
between the staff within the cash office and others (staff or customers)
without, and the counter will be built into a wall of the office. In
these circumstances, it is vital that the counter maintains the
integrity of the surrounding wall in terms of its penetration resistance
(and may well need to exceed it in terms of bullet resistance). It
should thus comprise a proprietary cashier window with in-built
transaction tray (preventing ‘line of fire’ access beneath the screen).
Where transactions include the passage of large bags, a proprietary
cash-transfer hatch or hopper to the requisite resistance level should
also be provided. (Note: see also paragraph 4.1.2 concerning
construction and security of cash offices).

In other cases, for example in some casinos, there may be a need for
cashier counters with a significant cash exposure potential which are
remote from a central cash office. Such counters will also need to offer
a level of protection to cashiers (and the cash for which they are
responsible) that is commensurate with the assessed risk. It is
important that any screens installed to protect cashiers continue up to
the structural floor above (ie through any false ceiling). (Paragraph
4.1.2 describes the standards for

> Figure 2: Transaction tray

![](./media/image17.jpeg)

manual attack resistant and bullet resistant screens, etc.)

As an alternative to fixed screens, ‘open’ counters may be constructed
to incorporate fast-rising (normally bullet-resistant) screens,
activated by staff who may feel personally threatened or who witness a
colleague under threat. Such screens typically rise from the counter to
the ceiling within a fraction of a second, totally isolating cashiers
from customers. Further guidance on the deployment of rising screens is
available from the BSIA publication, Code of Practice for Rising Screens
(BSIA form No. 321).

Whether integral with the cash office, or remote from it, the design of
the cashier counter position should allow for a ‘safe haven’ retreat so
that cashiers can immediately retreat into a place of relative safety
away from customer view should they feel threatened.

As with cash offices, the denial of access by unauthorised persons, and
the attack resistive quality of construction of remote cashier counters
are matters requiring careful consideration taking full account of the
likelihood of attack. Where large amounts of money are at risk and, in
the view of the insurer, the protection afforded to the cashier by the
design and construction of the remote cashier counter is inadequate but
the policyholder insists upon maintaining an ‘open-counter’ or
‘open-plan banking’ style as an important facet of their corporate
image, it may still be possible to reach a compromise solution by
reducing the on-demand availability of cash at the counter to a level
that serves to reduce the likelihood of a violent or threatening attack.
This could be achieved by introducing a well-advertised (by means of
signage) transaction limit, supported by a secure and rigorously applied
cash transfer system (eg vacuum tube/air-pressure transfer – see
paragraph 4.9), or transaction-limiting system (eg teller-assist
technology).

**4.7 Till points**

Retail till positions should preferably be positioned well away from
external doors in order to minimise their vulnerability to both snatch
attacks and violent or threatening opportunist raiders.

Strict cash-in-till limits should be applied to minimise the potential
cash loss – and in consequence also reduce the likelihood of a till raid
by any criminal with inside information.

Cash-in-till exposures can be managed by the use of a secure cash
transfer system (eg vacuum tube/air-pressure transfer, or
transaction-limiting system (eg teller-assist technology) or by the use
of at-till or local-to-till secure deposit facilities, whereby staff can
post surplus receipts into a robust, anchored container the keys to
which, for the purposes of removing deposits, are held by other,
non-front-line staff, or by a cash-in-transit (CIT) firm who will make
collections at safe times of day (preferably during

12

non-trading hours). Such systems/containers (other than some of the more
robustly-made machines) are generally not intended to hold cash out of
business hours, and are not constructed to a standard that would
withstand a determined attack with simple hand-tools.

**4.8 Customer interface cash payment, dispensing, changing, gaming and
vending machines**

Many businesses (and particularly those within the financial services,
retail, leisure and entertainment sectors) provide customer accessed
services via stand-alone and/or networked cash payment, recycling,
dispensing, changing, gaming and vending machines. These may be owned or
leased by the business itself, or supplied and managed (including
replenishment and withdrawal services) by a third party. Ownership and
responsibility for the cash within such machines needs to be established
for insurance purposes.

Such machines are, of course, intended to hold sufficient cash funds for
projected daily use during normal working hours, and some (eg
‘through-the-wall’ ATMs and ticketing machines) may also be expected
to hold cash out of normal working hours. As such, the security issues
presented by cash-holding machines (including replenishment) are dealt
with as specific topics later in this guide (see paragraphs. 5.4.1 and
5.4.2).

**4.9 Cash transfers within the business premises**

Cash transfers within the premises during business hours are often
necessary to facilitate the normal operational requirements of the
business, optimising the cash office function and minimising the time
required for cash reconciliation at the end of the business day.

![](./media/image18.jpeg)

Figure 3: Cash transfer unit

Whilst all movements of cash during business hours present some risk,
they more often than not, handled correctly, serve to reduce the overall
threat posed by day-time raiders, as they help to lessen the crime
incentive at the most exposed vulnerable point: the customer-facing
cashier or till operator.

Automated point-to-point delivery systems (eg those based on localised
air-pressure tube installations) generally offer the safest and most
secure means of transferring cash between cash office and
cashier/till-operator, permitting frequent cash-float management
transactions with little risk of interception by unauthorised persons.

As a general principle, staff-accompanied cash transfers within the
premises during business hours should be designed to take

the safest (not necessarily the shortest) route, avoiding potential
high-risk areas (eg immediately adjacent to customer entrance doors,
emergency exit routes, shared or non-staff-only corridors and lifts –
unless they can be restricted to security and cash-office staff use
only). Agreement should be reached on the number of personnel that must
accompany each consignment, the means of transportation (see below) and
the maximum amount that may be transferred per journey, and such
limit(s) should be ensured through management supervision.

It is generally preferable for staff-accompanied cash transfers to be
transported within a proprietary (or otherwise purpose-designed) cash
trolley incorporating attack-resistant cash container(s) which are
either permanently bolted or securely locked into position, and with the
means to remove cash (with or without cash container) not available to
those accompanying it. There are a range of such products available,
some with anti-snatch alarm facilities, raising a local audible alarm in
the event that the trolley is separated from its custodian (normally
wrist-link operated), but generally speaking, the bulkier the trolley,
the more likely that it will be a deterrent to day-time snatches/raids.

In circumstances where the volume and weight of cash to be transferred
is not great, policyholders might transport the cash in bags. A wide
variety of bags will be encountered during site surveys ranging from
simple cotton coin bags to alarmed cases to security bags equipped with
smoke-and-dye packs. Depending upon the amounts of cash being
transferred, it may be necessary to ask the policyholder to introduce
additional or alternative security measures (more escorts, improved
means of transportation) or else to apply lower cash limits per transit
(by increasing the frequency of collections/deliveries).

**4.10 Additional hold-up defences and deterrents**

***4.10.1 CCTV***

All significant cash risks should include continuously-recorded (minimum
25 frames per second) CCTV as a component of the overall security
programme. In order to maximise both the deterrence value and the
post-event benefit of the CCTV system, camera coverage needs to be
comprehensive and recorded image quality should be of sufficiently high
standard for criminal evidence personal identification purposes, with
clear, high resolution head-and-shoulders images available from at least
one camera of all persons entering or leaving the premises. The advice
of the police should be obtained.

Prominent and sufficient warning notices should be posted appropriately
leaving all customers and visitors in no doubt that a comprehensive CCTV
system is in operation. Reference should be made to the Data Protection
Act 1998 and accompanying Code of Practice. A copy of the Code of
Practice can be obtained from the Information Commissioner’s Office.

Camera placement should ensure good coverage of all external doors
(internal and external views), customer access areas, cashier
counter/till positions, cash office and security control room
(interiors, entry doors and approaches).

For heavier cash risks there should be active monitoring of CCTV images
from within the security control room (preferably throughout business or
trading hours, but at least during parts or the working day when there
is judged to be an enhanced risk).

***4.10.2 Security fog systems***

Security fog systems have been used to good effect by a number of banks
and retail jewellers as a defence against day-time raids.
Cashier-activated using deliberately operated devices (normally personal
attack buttons), anti-raid security fog systems are designed to ‘push’
the attackers away from the cashiers’ counter and back towards the
street entrance door. Typically, the fog deployment will be accompanied
by an automated, pre-recorded verbal warning intended to reassure lawful
customers that the security system has been activated, that the fog is
harmless and that the police have been called and will arrive shortly.

However, policyholders, advisors and specifiers such as consultants and
insurers must carry out a very careful risk assessment before
sanctioning or lending any degree of support for the technology in this
application – an assessment that takes account not only of the rationale
and expectations of the system but also the impact on legitimate
occupiers of the premises (staff, visitors and customers).

It is suggested that satisfactory completion of a sufficiently thorough
assessment would require collaboration with the manufacturer’s
representative and the installer of any triggering (ie hold-up alarm)
system. The fog products differ in their operation and it will be
necessary to evaluate whether the operational requirement can be met by
the way the equipment is expected to operate including the required
pattern of fog emission and the time that elapses before the fog in the
intended area of operation reaches the required density. BS EN 50131-8:
Alarm systems. Intrusion and hold-up systems. Security fog
device/systems permits this to be different from the minimum performance
standard in that document and experience suggests that in the hold-up
(as opposed to intrusion) application significantly more rapid
obscuration is essential. (Steps are being taken to revise the standard
so that specific requirements are included for robbery prevention).

Steps should also be taken to establish that the installer of the
triggering system will integrate and connect both systems in accordance
with manufacturers’ instructions, will correctly commission the
equipment and will ensure that the equipment is fully functional at all
necessary times (eg is not left deactivated in error following
maintenance).

Factors to take into account during the risk assessment should include
the reality that (i) the police will not enter a fog-filled environment
but will wait until the fog has dissipated (which may take a
considerable time) and (ii) that all persons (including customers and
staff) leaving the area are potentially liable to be treated as
potentially dangerous suspects by any responding police officers waiting
outside.

In the event that the policyholder decides to proceed with deployment,
having been fully involved in the risk assessment process, it is
important that all staff are fully trained in the appropriate use of the
system and witness a test or demonstration discharge.

Note: see paragraph 5.6 regarding the use of fog security systems for
protection of cash out of business hours. See also RISCAuthority Guide
S7: Security fog devices, for fuller guidance concerning the selection,
design and installation of such systems.

External doors should be of robust construction, particularly those in
more secluded, vulnerable positions such as at the rear of the premises.
Accessible windows and glazed panels in external doors should be
protected with steel security grilles, with the possible exception of
those at the front of the building where natural surveillance may render
a surreptitious intrusion attempt less likely.

The building should be fitted with good quality intruder alarm and CCTV
systems (see paragraph 5.5).

If the premises are protected by on-site security guards out of business
hours, it is imperative that they have no means to access (even under
duress) any part of the building containing money, or any other
sensitive areas, and that their presence does not in any way restrict
the coverage or hinder the operation of a comprehensive intruder alarm
system.

The most reliable means to ensure that the chosen guarding contractor
complies fully with the current edition of BS 7499:

Static site guarding and mobile patrol services. Code of practice, and
Security Industry Authority (SIA) rules, is to restrict the selection
field to those companies that are approved by the National Security
Inspectorate (NSI) or the Security Systems and Alarm Inspection Board
(SSAIB). If the customer’s preferred contractor is not approved under
the guarding scheme operated by either of these inspectorate bodies, it
should be ensured that it is at least approved under the Security
Industry Authority’s Approved Contractors Scheme (SIA-ACS).

**5.2 Safes**

Not all products marketed as safes are, in fact, intended for the
safeguarding of cash or valuables against theft, and those units that
are designed primarily to protect their contents against fire damage
(fire safes and data safes) are generally unlikely to warrant more (and
often rather less) than an insurer’s lowest nominal cash safe limit.

For significant cash exposures, the only safes likely to be sufficiently
robust to be acceptable to insurers are the higher-rated free-standing
(ie floor-standing) units, although some of the highest quality
under-floor safes might be accepted in some circumstances for moderately
high cash limits. Wall-safes are unlikely to be considered to offer
adequate security.

***5.2.1 Resistance grades and overnight limits***

Insurers normally expect cash safes, ATM safes, strong-rooms and
strong-room doors that are marketed within the UK to be certified by a
recognised certification body as having achieved a particular attack
resistance level as defined in BS EN 1143-1:

Secure storage units. Requirements, classification and methods of test
for resistance to burglary. Safes, ATM safes, strongroom doors and
strongrooms, or BS EN 14450: Secure storage units. Requirements,
classification and methods of test for resistance to burglary. Secure
safe cabinets, and will typically then award them a nominal overnight
cash limit according to their own underwriting policies and
categorisation models. These nominal overnight cash limits will,
depending upon the individual insurer’s underwriting philosophies,
normally range from the low £ thousands up to low 6-figure sums.
Case-specific limits may vary from nominal limits (again according to
underwriting philosophies) depending upon risk-specific factors such as
the extent and quality of intruder alarm protection and other security
measures.

Where a safe is encountered that has not been independently tested and
certified (eg because it was produced before the

> European standards became available, or because it has entered the UK
> market via a non-traditional route), the insurer will need either to
> make its own technical comparison with already rated safes, or rely

attacks on high-rated cash safes in situ are a comparative rarity. Even
with the necessary skills, knowledge and tools to overcome a high
specification cash safe, a safe-breaking expert would still also need to
factor-in the time required to penetrate the unit and the noise that may
be created in doing so.

Forcible opening of a high quality safe is a more favourable proposition
for the safe-breaker if the unit can be uplifted and removed to a
location where it can be attacked over a prolonged period without risk
of discovery.

The location and fixing of the safe are thus important features for
consideration in the risk assessment process. If the safe is positioned
deep within the premises, in a basement or on an upper floor and in a
location that does not lend itself to access with lifting equipment,
then it will be far less vulnerable to removal than a safe positioned on
the ground floor of (say) a megastore or retail park unit, within close
proximity to loading doors and with only light partitioning to prevent
access with the policyholder’s own fork lift trucks. Similarly, a 500kg
safe that has been securely anchored to a concrete floor by a competent
safe installation engineer in the manner prescribed by the safe
manufacturer will be far more difficult to uplift than an identical unit
that has simply been placed in position with no fixing to the floor or
walls.

Whilst all freestanding safes should be anchored in accordance with the
manufacturer’s recommendations, it is generally an imperative for safes
weighing less than 1,000kg. Even if the safe is positioned on a timber
or raised steel floor rather than on a solid concrete floor, a competent
safe engineer can normally deploy a compromise anchoring solution that
will achieve an acceptable degree of protection against removal.

Whilst retro-fit solutions can generally be freely specified when
unanchored safes are encountered on survey, a poorly located safe can
present greater difficulties, since relocating it will often be
impracticable. In particularly unfavourable circumstances, the surveyor
may need to consider the need for alternative compensatory protections
(eg a security fog system or enhanced surveillance) if the full
money-in-safe limit is to be awarded.

An argument sometimes encountered when specifying a heavy cash safe for
use on an upper floor is that the prescribed floor loading limit will
preclude it. Such concerns are often unfounded but, even if verified,
such restraints can usually be overcome by the use of floor-load
spreader plates, and a good safe supply company will be able to
determine (in consultation where necessary with a structural engineer)
the optimum solution in terms of safe and spreader plate sizes.

***5.2.5 Locking arrangements***

Cash safes are available with a variety of locks and most modern
products are available with the customer’s preferred lock type.

The minimum number and quality of locks required is specified within BS
EN 1143-1 according to grade of safe (eg a minimum of one EN
1300<sup>13</sup> Class B lock for a Grade 3 safe). All safes Graded 4
and above must be fitted with a minimum of 2 locks and, depending on
Grade, these locks are required to be Class B, C or D).

*5.2.5.1 Key locks and key security*

Where safes are fitted with mechanical key-operated locks it is
important to establish that the keys supplied with the safe

<sup>13</sup> EN 1300: Secure storage units. Classification for high
security locks according to their resistance to unauthorized opening.

(they are always supplied in duplicate) can be accounted for. If the
whereabouts of any key (either supplied originally or as an additional
copy) can not be ascertained, the safe lock(s), lever set(s) or
equivalent, must be replaced by a qualified safe specialist and the
replacement keys assigned to the nominated keyholders.

Furthermore, safe keys must be retained in the custody of senior,
authorised personnel and be removed from the premises when they are left
unattended. Sometimes, for operational convenience, keys to good quality
cash safes are kept in another safe, often of lesser quality. Logically,
from a pure ‘exposure versus control’ perspective in such circumstances,
the maximum cash at risk in the better safe ought not to exceed the
overnight cash limit available for the poorer quality unit if overcoming
the latter will give thieves free entry to the former. Moreover, even
this figure should be reduced by the equivalent of any cash value held
in the poorer product.

The evaluation may be further complicated depending on whether the good
quality safe has more than one lock, whether the key lock in question is
the primary or secondary locking device, and what precautions are in
place to ensure the non-availability of the key – or the secrecy of the
combination – to the other lock.

Such arrangements are highly problematic and are very unlikely to
represent a satisfactory compromise to either the policyholder or the
insurer. It should be generally recognised that any arrangement whereby
safe keys are left on the premises (eg in key cabinets or in other
safes) when unattended is normally unacceptable and in all likelihood
would, in any event, be a breach of money insurance policy conditions.

*5.2.5.2 Combination locks, PIN locks and code security*

Mechanical combination locks and electronic PIN locks overcome the main
risks associated with key locks (ie the loss or misappropriation and
subsequent unauthorised use of keys), but introduce other potential
problems (ie the possibility that knowledge of the combination or PIN
number will become known by unauthorised persons).

It should thus be ensured that the combination number is made available
to the minimum number of suitably authorised personnel only (one PIN
number per authorised user in the case of electronic locks), that it is
not recorded anywhere in writing or electronically and that the number
is changed routinely (eg every 6 or 12 months) and every time that a
‘keyholder’ leaves the policyholder’s employment or a breach in
security is suspected. It is also necessary to ensure through
positioning of the safe, through staff training and through management
controls, that entry of the combination or PIN numbers cannot be
witnessed by other persons.

*5.2.5.3 Dual locking*

Any safe that is required to hold significant amounts of money (whether
or not it is a modern ‘BS EN Graded’ safe) should be equipped with at
least two locks and it should be ensured that

(i) both locks are secured whenever the safe is left unattended and (ii)
two persons are always required to be present in order to unlock the
safe (ie the means to release each lock is entrusted to distinct
keyholders, and no one person holds both keys, or key and combination,
etc).

As an added security measure, the safe ‘keyholders’ should not
themselves have the means to unlock the building or unset the premises
intruder alarm system .

Greater management control can thus be exercised, without major cost or
inconvenience, over the security of safes than is possible with
traditional, mechanical key or combination locks. For risks with
multiple locations, it is also possible to fit remotely managed
electronic locks so that the various adjustable functions and parameters
may be configured over an entire estate of safes, audit trails may be
viewed from a central location, and event alerts or exception reports
(eg safe remaining open after set time) can be transmitted to a security
manager or response officer. Such remote functionality must, of course,
not extend to allow any ‘unlock’ commands.

> When recommending the installation of a deposit safe, it

is important to do so by reference to the current edition of BS EN
1143-2: Secure storage units. Requirements, classification and methods
of test for resistance to burglary. Deposit systems.

If a safe is fitted with a deposit facility that has not been certified
to BS EN 1143-2, and it is left containing cash out of business hours,
the Insurer should consider whether the unit warrants the full
out-of-hours cash limit normally granted for the safe model in question,
or whether it should be reduced in recognition of a possibly
significantly lessened resistance to forcible entry. Some deposit
facilities, for example, comprise little more than a posting slot at the
top of a safe, with a baffle plate beneath to hamper ‘fishing’ attacks
(although such simplistic arrangements are normally confined to lower
grade products), and with the safe body’s integrity already compromised
to such a significant extent, a much reduced overnight limit might be
necessary.

On the other hand, if the deposit system has achieved a resistance Grade
under BS EN 1143-2 that matches the Grade achieved by the standard safe
model itself (and certification is by an organisation recognised by the
Insurer) then there should be no need to discount the out-of-hours limit
normally awarded for the particular safe model.

Safe deposit systems can sometimes be retro-fitted to existing cash
safes, but it can be a very disruptive and expensive process, and it is
generally preferable to replace the existing safe with a factory-made
deposit safe of at least similar Grade.

> **5.3 Strong-rooms**

Where the physical volume of cash (and/or other valuable property) at
risk is such that cash safes would be unable to provide sufficient
capacity, strongrooms can offer a viable alterative. Modern products
tend to be of the ‘demountable’ (pre-fabricated and assembled on site)
type rather than the more traditional ‘built-in-situ’ strong-room or
vault and, like cash safes, they should be independently tested and
certified against BS EN 1143-1.

Strong-room components, assemblies and doors that have been certified as
achieving a certain resistance grade under the standard are considered
to be acceptable for the same nominal cash limits that are awarded by
individual insurers to cash safes that have achieved the same grading.
Since strong-room doors may be purchased separately from wall, roof and
floor assemblies however, it is important to ensure that the grades are
identical. If not, the nominal cash limit awarded to the whole assembly
should be based on the lowest graded element.

Some strong-rooms and strong-room doors marketed in the UK have achieved
Underwriters’ Laboratories (UL) 608 ratings rather than BS EN 1143-1
gradings and Insurers will need to determine, when confronted with such
a product, where it should stand within their safes/strongrooms rating
tables. A comparison of the test specifications associated with each
standard by experts in the industry suggests the following approximate
equivalence. (The different approaches adopted within each standard mean
that a direct equivalence cannot be demonstrated, and alternative claims
of relative superiority might be argued):

|            |                  |
| ---------- | ---------------- |
| **UL 608** | **BS EN 1143-1** |
|            |                  |
| Class M    | Grade 1          |
|            |                  |
| Class 1    | Grade 5          |
|            |                  |
| Class 2    | Grade 7          |
|            |                  |
| Class 3    | Grade 9          |
|            |                  |

It is not uncommon to encounter strong-rooms or vaults in situ when
assessing heavy cash risks and, unless the unit is reasonably modern and
still bears its certification plate or other positive indicators, model
(or quality) identification can sometimes be as problematic as is often
the case with identifying older ‘anonymous’ safes, and the assistance of
an industry expert may need to be sought. On close inspection or
enquiry, many strong-room doors to built-in-situ strong-rooms or vaults
are found to be ‘book-quality’ doors of between 12 and 25mm steel plate,
and nominal cash limits typical of cash safes with such door
construction may thus be appropriate, provided that the walls, ceiling
and floor of the vault are assessed as offering at least broadly
equivalent resistance (which would generally mean cast-in-situ,
specially reinforced concrete rather than bricks or blocks).

ATM safes certified by recognised certification bodies to EN 1143-1 may
reasonably be considered as deserving of similar out-of-hours cash
limits as are safes of similar Grade, provided that the Insurer is
satisfied as to positioning and anchoring (particularly in light of the
number of ram-raid attacks on through-the-wall and even lobby ATMs).

***5.4.2 Other customer interface and cashier support machines***

There are, in today’s financial, leisure and retail sectors especially,
a host of cash-handling, receiving, recycling, changing, gaming and
vending machines available and insurers will encounter many such devices
in use within policyholders’ premises, some in back-office and
customer-facing cashier situations, but more particularly, installed in
publicly-accessible areas for direct use by customers.

Depending on the number of such machines, their cash-loading and
unloading characteristics and the operational requirements in any
particular business location, it can sometimes prove impracticable to
routinely empty them at the close of business each day and reload them
at the start of following day. Where it is practicable however, it
should be encouraged since few of these machines offer much resistance
to violent attack. Furthermore, the cost of repairing or replacing the
machine following an attack can often exceed the value of cash contents
stolen, so emptying machines and advertising the fact (with signage,
leaving empty cash-containers unlocked and ajar) can sometimes save
significant claims payouts. Where large cash exposures (per unit or in
the aggregate) will remain in machines out of business hours (and the
Insurer has agreed to consider providing an element of cash cover beyond
the normal policy out-of-safe limit) it will be necessary to make an
assessment of the container’s ability to withstand an attack, of the
anchoring arrangements to prevent its removal and of additional security
arrangements that will help to deter, prevent or hinder an attack. It is
likely that in every case, a good standard of alarm protection will be
required and in many instances a security fog installation will be
necessary. Many containers will be found to be constructed essentially
of sheet steel, between 2mm and 5mm thick, with doors secured sometimes
with multiple bolts but often with only a single bolt thrown by a simple
low-grade lock (sometimes just a light cam-lock) and are thus vulnerable
to forcible opening using simple hand-tools and elementary knowledge
only.

Replenishment and removal of cash of and from such machines should,
wherever possible, be undertaken at the beginning and end of each
working day when the premises are closed to customers and external doors
are secured.

In an attempt to reconcile the relative vulnerability of some machines
with the customer’s wish to avoid the need for end-of-day removal of
contents, a recent development has seen the introduction of in-safe
banknote management (‘recycling’) machines, whereby the cash-handling
machine is positioned on a rail-mounted sliding platform that extends
from within an otherwise unmodified EN 1143-1 – certificated safe for
use during working hours, and is pushed back into the safe (the door to
which is then locked) until the start of the next working day. Provided
that the safe is suitable for the maximum cash limit anticipated and has
been properly anchored, etc, there should be no need for cash to be
removed from the machine overnight.

**5.5 Intruder alarm and CCTV protection**

All out-of-hours cash exposures of any significance should be intruder
alarm protected to a high standard. The system should be to Grade 3 or 4
of BS EN 50131: Alarm systems. Intrusion and hold-up systems with Level
1 police response. It should incorporate a dual path alarm transmission
system (ATS) suitable for use with EN 50131-1 compliant systems up to
and including security Grade 4, notification option C, ie with a
performance level of ATS5 (ideally independently certified). The system
design should

> ensure that a confirmed alarm will be generated before intruders reach
> any cash safes, ATMs or other cash containers within the premises. In
> addition to protecting normally envisaged access points (doors and
> windows) and routes, consideration should also, for such risks, be
> given to the possibility of intrusion through walls or floors,
> particularly from any neighbouring vacant properties.
> 
> Set and unset signals should be monitored by the ARC for compliance
> with notified closing and opening time windows, and any deviations (eg
> failure to set, or out-of-hours/early unset) should be immediately
> notified to the policyholder’s duty keyholders.
> 
> Safes, strong-rooms and ATMs holding significant amounts of cash
> should be additionally protected with safe ‘limpet’ or vault-guard

> thefts, collusion, alarm system compromise by masking movement
> detectors, etc.
> 
> Irrespective of the value of cash contents, all through-the-wall cash
> machines and safes (such as pavement-accessed ATMs and CIT company
> serviced cash transfer safes) and any lobby installed cash machines

> 
> All ATMs and other machines holding, receiving and dispensing cash in

> 
> **5.7 Banknote degradation and unique tagging systems**

As an added deterrent, safes, ATMs and other (banknote) cash containers
may be fitted with automated banknote degradation and unique tagging
systems (see paragraph 4.10.4) activated by attack-sensing devices
mounted within the unit. In addition to the familiar ‘smoke and dye’
note marking materials, systems are now available that aim to render
stacks of banknotes unusable by the use of an adhesive to solidify them
and prevent non-destructive separation.

  - Use of an estimated time of arrival (ETA) notification procedure

  - Provision of a safe and secure environment for the transaction

  - Provision of a safe and secure route from the cash office (if the
    transaction point is remote from it)

  - Strict adherence to documented procedures, especially identity
    checking of CIT personnel, validation of the presented
    (daily-issued, day and duty-specific) collection authorisation card,
    clear marking and checking of cash amounts collected/delivered.

There may, in consequence, need to be an increased number of transits in
order to meet the cash-flow needs of the business and to avoid exceeding
policy limits on cash on the premises.

> 
> ***6.2.3 Conveyance methods and security***

Transits by staff should be as discreet as possible, with times, routes
and amounts known only to a minimum number of responsible personnel, and
with care taken to avoid, as far as possible, identifiable and
predictable routines.

  - the vehicle used for such purposes will generally be making several
    stops before returning to base, with each one resulting in a
    steadily increasing temptation to robbers who are prepared to
    research their targets prior to launching an attack.

<!-- end list -->

  - the risk assessment carried out by the policyholder will probably
    have concluded that it would be safer for the accumulating payload
    to be secured within the vehicle, rather than being carried by an
    operative on foot in public areas whilst making further pick-ups.
    (Note: this may be a breach of a policy condition or exclusion
    relating to money in an unattended vehicle, unless there are two
    operatives carrying out the round and one remains on watch in the
    vehicle whilst the other attends to the pick-up).

The vehicle should be fitted with a good quality vehicle deposit safe
(either securely bolted/welded in place or of the removable,
base-plate-mounted type), to which the collection staff have no keys,
and all cash should be put into the safe immediately upon collection.
The safe should not be visible from outside the vehicle when its doors,
hatches and boot are closed, and there should be clear signage on the
safe regarding the non-availability of keys to open or (if applicable)
remove the safe from its mounting.
