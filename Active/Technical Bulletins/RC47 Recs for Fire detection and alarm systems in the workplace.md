**LOSS PREVENTION RECOMMENDATIONS**

The aim of the FPA series of Recommendations is to provide loss
prevention guidance for industrial and commercial premises and systems.
The series continues a long tradition of providing authoritative
guidance on loss prevention issues started by the Fire Offices’
Committee (FOC) of the British insurance industry more than a hundred
years ago and builds upon earlier publications from the Loss Prevention
Council and the Association of British Insurers.

Lists of other publications on loss control including other documents in
the RC series are available at www.thefpa.co.uk and from the FPA at
London Road, Moreton-in-Marsh, Gloucestershire GL56 0RH. Copies of

11. • a need to meet the requirements of the Building Regulations,
    either by way of prescriptive or deemed to satisfy requirements such
    as Approved Document B (ref. 3), or as a result of a fire engineered
    solution;

This document provides guidance to insurance surveyors and system users
on the requirements for the effective management of fire detection and
alarm systems in the workplace.

Guidance is provided on the accepted standards to which systems should
be designed and installed; the need for suitable system installation
certificates; testing, inspection and maintenance guidelines; the use of
third-party accredited service providers; the control of unwanted alarms
as outlined in BS 5839-1: 2002: *Fire* *detection and fire alarm systems
for buildings. Code of practice for system design, installation,
commissioning and maintenance* (ref. 1) and the Chief Fire Officers’
Association (CFOA) *Model Agreement between Fire and* *Rescue
Authorities and Users of Remotely Monitored Fire Alarm Systems,* 2004
(ref. 2).

**SYNOPSIS**

These recommendations introduce the Chief Fire Officers’ Association
(CFOA) *Model Agreement between* *Fire and Rescue Authorities and Users
of Remotely Monitored Fire Alarm Systems* and explain the users’
obligations to conform to this document.

Emphasis is given to the need to minimise unwanted and false fire alarm
signals and how this may be carried out in practice.

**DEFINITIONS**

**False alarm:** A fire signal resulting from causes other than fire
(for example, resulting from steam).

**Unwanted alarm:** A fire signal caused by a fire-like phenomenon (for
example, smoke from bread in a toaster).

  - the findings of fire risk assessments conducted to meet the
    requirements of UK fire safety legislation under the Regulatory
    Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005 in England and Wales (ref. 4) and
    equivalent legislation in Scotland and Northern Ireland (refs. 5 to
    7); or assessments to address specific fire safety objectives, such
    as the protection of property and high value assets and business
    continuity;

  - other relevant legislation, such as licensing, Dangerous Substances
    and Explosive Atmospheres Regulations 2002 (DSEAR) (ref. 8), housing
    and local Acts;

  - requirements or recommendations from the insurance industry.

> Like most fire engineering disciplines, fire detection and alarm
> system technology has evolved over recent years, resulting in a need

> 
> The need to manage and reduce unwanted alarms continues to receive

> 
> The volume of unwanted alarm signals relayed via remote alarm
> receiving centres to the fire service and the resulting fire brigade
> response has inevitably impacted on the operational and financial

>

fire and rescue services is now the norm, with some considering the
possibility of a nil response to the worst offenders, or only responding
with pumping appliances if the alarm has been confirmed by an eye
witness.

It is therefore important that users are aware of the official alarm
response policy for their area and are encouraged to contact their local
fire and rescue authority on an annual basis for confirmation in terms
of the brigade’s Integrated Risk Management Plan. (Details of fire cover
are also available, and searchable by postcode, on the InFiReS website,
*www.infires.co.uk*).

The latest revision of BS 5839-1 (ref. 1) addresses the limitation of
false alarms in considerable detail, from both the design and end use
perspective. The Chief Fire Officers’ Association (CFOA) has also
released a policy to minimise the unnecessary burden on fire services as
a result of turning out to unwanted alarms (ref. 2). The issuance of
unique reference numbers for individual automatic fire detection
installations, certification for the design and installation of systems
and alarm receiving centres are all addressed in this policy.

The CFOA policy has been adopted in full or part by most fire brigades.
In the meantime, the initial response to alarm activations has generally
been reduced to one pump to premises other than residential, healthcare
and other high life risk occupancies.

Generally, the reliability and dependability of a system will be
influenced by:

  - > the adequacy of the design;

  - > the reliability of the components used;

  - > the quality of the installation;

  - > how effectively the system is inspected, maintained, tested and
    > managed on a day-to-day basis.

Inspection and maintenance of life safety systems is also a requirement
of certain UK fire safety legislation such as the Regulatory Reform
(Fire Safety) Order 2005 in England and Wales (ref. 4) and the
equivalent legislation in Scotland and Northern Ireland (refs. 5 to 7).

2.  **Unwanted and false alarms**

> High levels of false or unwanted alarms have, for some time, been
> unacceptable to the government, emergency services and standards
> generating bodies, such as the British Standards Institution. Some
> typical causes of false and unwanted alarms are set out in Table 1.
> The issue is addressed in detail in both BS 5839-1: 2002 and the Chief
> Fire Officers’ Association (CFOA) Model Agrement, 2007 (refs. 1 and
> 2).
> 
> BS 5839-1: 2002 addresses the categories of false alarms, acceptable
> rates, causes and measures to limit their occurrence.

1.  Measures to prevent unwanted/false alarms that should be addressed
    at the system design stage include:
    
      - > the selection and siting of fire detectors and call-points;
    
      - > protection against electromagnetic interference;
    
      - > system performance monitoring;
    
      - > filtering measures.

2.  Measures to prevent unwanted/false alarms after a system has been
    installed, commissioned and handed over include:
    
      - > service, inspection and maintenance;
    
      - > effective fire safety management.

3.  The code accepts that false/unwanted alarm rates will be influenced
    by several factors, but also recognises that the anticipated
    unwanted alarm rate is likely to be proportional to the number of
    automatic detectors incorporated in the system. As a result, this
    code of practice recommends the following:
    
      - > for systems incorporating more than 40 detectors in any
        > rolling year, the average false

4

![](./media/image5.jpeg)

> alarm rate should not exceed one false alarm per 20 detectors, or not
> more than two false alarms from any single detector or call-point.

  - > for systems with 40 detectors or less, no more than two false
    > alarms should occur in any rolling year.

> Where these rates are exceeded, an in-depth investigation into the
> cause should be initiated and suitable mitigating action taken.

4.  Nevertheless, the code recommends that a preliminary investigation
    should be conducted as part of the service work and the user
    informed accordingly if any of the following occurs:
    
      - > the rate of false alarms over the 12 month period exceeded one
        > alarm per 25 detectors;
    
      - > more than 10 false alarms have occurred since the last service
        > visit;
    
      - > two or more false alarms have arisen from any single detector
        > or call-point;
    
      - > any persistent cause of a false alarm is identified.

> All alarm activations should therefore be accurately recorded for
> periodic review and analysis.

5.  Malicious false alarms are most likely to involve manual call-point
    activation. Occupancies prone to this may include schools,
    universities, public car-parks, shopping centres and public
    entertainment venues, such as cinemas, theatres, public houses and
    night-clubs. Measures to avoid

> Table 1: Examples of causes of false and unwanted alarms
> 
> these include fitting call-points with hinged plastic covers that need
> to be raised before the glass can be broken, thus eliminating the
> alarm being raised by accidental collision with the device.

6.  Subject to the approval of the enforcing authority, consideration
    could be given to the following to help reduce potential malicious
    false alarms involving call-points:
    
      - > not siting call-points within the mall areas of covered
        > shopping centres;
    
      - > subject to adequate surveillance of the premises by persons or
        > CCTV, siting call-points at staffed locations and in areas
        > only accessible to authorised persons, or the use of
        > call-points with hinged covers thereby requiring a dual action
        > before the alarm is raised;
    
      - > the use of an emergency voice communication system linked to a
        > permanently manned location, such as a security control room
        > in lieu of the provision of call-points in public car parks.

7.  A staff alarm arrangement is sometimes used in large and complex
    buildings to filter potential false alarms. This provides a period
    after activation of a detector to investigate, prior to the
    operation of the alarm. Where the alert signal is not silenced
    within a limited period – usually a maximum of six minutes – the
    system will automatically revert to an alarm condition. Signals from
    manual call-points normally produce an alarm condition and are not
    subject to the staff alarm arrangement.

> 
> For example, under the CFOA agreement, a system with 400 detectors

  - > an Attendance Level One for a performance level of seven or less
    > false alarms in a 12 month period;

  - > an Attendance Level Two for a performance level of between seven
    > and ten false alarms in a 12 month period;

  - > an Attendance Level Three where the number of false alarms in 12
    > months exceeds ten.

> By comparison, under BS 5839-1, the user would instigate an in-depth
> investigation if, over a rolling year, more than 20 false alarms
> occurred for a system with 400 detectors, or if more than two false
> alarms were received from any single detector or call-point.

*Note: The CFOA Model Agreement is currently under review and it is
likely that a new edition will be published in early 2008. Readers
should however be aware that the aims and general processes outlined
here will not change.*

3.  **Site control and responsibilities**

<!-- end list -->

1.  Key requirements for the effective site control of fire detection
    and alarm systems include:
    
      - > a named responsible person appointed to supervise the system.
        > This would be a ‘competent person’ appointed by the
        > ‘responsible person’ in terms of UK fire legislation;
    
      - > control and indicating equipment checked every 24 hours to
        > confirm no faults indicated;
    
      - > system log book up-to-date and available for inspection.
        > Recommend a copy of the design, installation, commissioning
        > and acceptance certificate be kept in the log book;
    
      - > all occupants have received suitable instruction regarding the
        > system including interpretation of alarm conditions and faults
        > and the actions to be taken in accordance with the company’s
        > emergency plan and the measures to avoid false/unwanted
        > alarms;
    
      - > records regularly reviewed including false/unwanted alarm
        > rates;
    
      - > regular visual inspections to ensure that manual call-points
        > remain unobstructed and that a clear space of 500mm is
        > maintained around all detectors;
    
    <!-- end list -->

        > the responsible person, details of the maintenance
        > arrangements, details of all signals, causes of false/unwanted
        > alarms, full details of all tests/maintenance, and details of
        > all faults and defects;
    
      - > copies of the following system certificates should be kept
        > readily available on site:
        
          - > design certificate;
        
          - > installation certificate;
        
          - > commissioning certificate;
        
          - > acceptance certificate;
        
          - > verification and modification certificates as relevant;
        
          - > inspection and servicing certificates.

<!-- end list -->

1.  UK fire legislation requires that the ‘responsible person’ in terms
    of the Regulatory Reform Order (and similar legislation in other
    parts of the UK) appoint one or more competent persons to assist in
    undertaking the required preventive and protective measures.

> This implies that competent persons will need to be appointed to
> conduct the testing, inspection and maintenance of the fire detection
> and alarm system.

2.  Routine testing can be conducted in-house by suitably knowledgeable
    and experienced persons. Suitable training to improve these skills
    should be available from the supplier/installer, or short courses
    available from fire safety training organisations.

> However, unless specialist knowledge is available within an
> organisation, periodic inspection and testing is likely to be carried
> out by a specialist service provider. Competency can be assured by
> using an organisation that is third-party certificated by a
> UKAS-accredited certification body. The Loss Prevention Certification
> Board sets out *Requirements for* *Certificated Fire Detection and
> Alarm System Firms* in LPS 1014 (ref. 15) and BAFE operates SP203-1:
> *Fire Detection, Alarm and Suppression* *Systems Scheme* (ref. 16).

4.  Routine testing and inspection frequencies should be based on the
    outcome of a fire risk assessment that has taken into consideration
    the type of system and environment in which it is installed. BS
    5839-1: 2002 recommends a maximum period of six months between
    inspections, but more frequent inspection where determined necessary
    by the risk assessment.

5.  When a user is changing service providers, the servicing
    organisation is likely to conduct a special inspection to obtain
    sufficient information for future servicing and to determine areas
    of non-compliance such as:
    
      - > inadequate provision of call-points;
    
      - > inadequate detector coverage;
    
      - > sound pressure level deficiencies;
    
      - > inadequate stand-by power supplies;
    
      - > cabling not meeting the requirements of BS 5839-1: 2002;

> **4** **System testing, inspection and maintenance**
> 
> Table 3: System testing, inspection and maintenance routines

  - > non-compliance regarding monitoring of circuits;

  - > unsatisfactory standards of electrical safety;

  - > excessive unwanted/false alarm ratios;

  - > structural changes that may adversely affect the efficiency of the
    > system;

  - > system log book and record-keeping deficiencies.

<!-- end list -->

5.  To facilitate arrangements for the repair of any faults or damage,
    it is recommended that suitable arrangements for emergency call-out
    be agreed with the supplier (24 hour coverage with attendance of a
    technician within 8 hours of notification from the end user). The
    contact details of the service provider should also be prominently
    displayed at the main control and indicating equipment.

6.  The insurance broker/company for the property should be informed in
    the event of the fire alarm system being inoperative, or with
    remotely monitored systems, the level of fire and rescue service
    response being reduced or withdrawn.
